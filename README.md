The goal of this project: To learn basic IOS development and try to meet the requirements for class

Plans for this project: Finish creating a basic task manager while learning and trying to implement everything we have learned in class. 
I plan on trying to create a minimalistic task-tracking app to try and help myself stay on track daily. I also think that this will be a good
learning opportunity for myself in order to code a little more and do something new.

Current App: This app currently is able to add a task the user wishes to add with a time and date that the user wishes to add and the task 
will currently be added in order of date and time. The user is able to mark the task as complete, greying out the task, and also gives the user the 
option of deleting the app if they wish.
