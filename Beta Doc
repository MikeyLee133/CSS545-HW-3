What I need to complete for the Beta:
I want to work on being able to allow the user to group curtain task together depending on their prefernces or possiibly added some kind of priority sorting, so important task
end up on the top. I also wish the try and added some sort of push notifaction to the user when a task with a higher priority is comming up in order to notify the user. 

I may need to talk to the professor to see what else might need to be added or what path I should take this App, however, currently this is my plan for the app otherthan small minor changes.
